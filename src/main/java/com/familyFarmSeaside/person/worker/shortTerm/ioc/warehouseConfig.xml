<!--  you can add some object(other classes are also supported) here but due to the complexity of class
 relationship I suggest just try with warehouse -->
<!--  Please refer to the JavaBean Standard -->
<!--  The class written here has to have a constructor of no args-->
<!--  And the set...() method has to be upper cased in the first letter-->
<!--  setName() setNumber() are 2 examples-->
<bean id="warehouse_1" class="main.java.com.familyFarmSeaside.scene.warehouse.Warehouse">
  <property name="cost" value="65432.1"/>
  <property name="name" value="Jiading no. 1 warehouse"/>
  <property name="floorNumber" value="5"/>
